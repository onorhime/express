(TSXV: DMGI) (DMGGF: OTCQB) (FSE: 6AX) (&#8220;DMG&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency technology company is pleased to provide an update regarding its Core+ operations, following up on its conference call held on April 22, 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DMG Core+ Strategy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Company has been aggressively focusing on its Core+ software platforms, following the development of its Core+ data centre infrastructure. All DMG software operates under the Blockseer brand, a 100% owned subsidiary of DMG. Blockseer has a range of crypto-specific services already operating, which include Explorer, Walletscore, Pool, and Mine Manager. As of today, Blockseer\u2019s Pool platform, a licenced technology which includes \u201cClean Block\u201d mining, is operating over 1 Exahash (1,000 Petahash) for its client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally a pool will charge an average of 2% for its fees to users. Over a single week of mining with approximately 1 Exahash (1,000 Petahash) at today\u2019s bitcoin price, it would be expected that pool fees charged would be approximately USD$45,000 per week per Exahash. DMG, licensing its technology, takes a negotiated fee via its overall pool fee for Blockseer\u2019s services and technologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blockseer Pool is currently producing blocks at its statistically expected rate which, with its current hashrate, will generate approximately 225 bitcoin per month. As a critical component of our Core+ services, Blockseer&#8217;s mining pool is now an active revenue generator; with over 1 Eh\/s running on the pool network for DMG\u2019s client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am incredibly proud of my team, and their diligent work over the last year to take our Blockseer Pool offering from inception to production. This represents the next step in DMG&#8217;s focus towards full vertical integration in the creation of bitcoin, and is the foundation for becoming more involved in the entire bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d said Adrian Glover, Chief Technology Officer of DMG.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDMG is very excited for the ongoing growth of the Blockseer platforms,\u201d commented Sheldon Bennett, DMG\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe now have four operating platforms (Explorer, Walletscore, Pool and Mine Manager), and with the coming additions of Breeze and Freeze (Blockseer\u2019s custody wallet solutions), and Petra, which is now patent pending, and focuses on solving regulatory issues for banks and financial institutions as they add Bitcoin operations. In the coming months, as we move forward with our plans to add crypto exchange capabilities to Blockseer, DMG is investing significantly in new revenue generating products beyond pure crypto mining.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DMG is a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency company that manages, operates, and develops end-to-end digital solutions to monetize the blockchain ecosystem.
