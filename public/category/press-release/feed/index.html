<p>VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSXV: DMGI) (DMGGF: OTCQB) (FSE: 6AX) (&#8220;DMG&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency technology company, and Argo Blockchain Plc (OTCQB US: ARBKF), a UK-based global cryptocurrency mining company, today announced their partnership in the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) to promote the decarbonization of the cryptocurrency industry. Alongside the CCA, DMG and Argo are developing a new working group to more clearly outline the CCA’s objectives, while deploying new technologies that increase the transparency of the renewable energy sourcing of crypto mining.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>DMG and Argo, both industry leaders in the development of clean mining, are working with the CCA to ensure the accord&#8217;s objectives promote meaningful impact in reducing overall emissions for the crypto industry. The companies are working to align their goals and objectives with the CCA while enhancing current protocols, demonstrating an industry-leading commitment to environmental stewardship and to addressing the criticisms regarding industry greenwashing.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>A result of this dialogue has been the refining of the CCA’s objectives, including the addition of a signatory commitment by founding members, DMG and Argo.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>An amplified demand in cryptocurrencies has highlighted the ecological impacts that blockchain-based technology can, and will, have on the world. Bitcoin miners around the world currently account for up to an estimated 0.5% of global power usage. There is an immediate and crucial opportunity to decarbonize this growing power usage. In April of this year, founding members of the CCA, a private sector-led initiative, committed to making the cryptocurrency industry powered with 100% renewable energy.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“Since our inception, DMG has been committed to transparency and good governance,” said Sheldon Bennett, CEO of DMG Blockchain Solutions. “Partnering with the Crypto Climate Accord alongside Argo allows us to apply those values to put us on a path to become a more sustainable industry. Together, we can finally put the wheels in motion to transition the cryptocurrency industry into one that focuses on renewable energy.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“As more data continues to surface regarding Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining’s impact on the environment, it’s imperative that the industry takes real, tangible action,” said Peter Wall, CEO of Argo. “The Crypto Climate Accord helps lay the groundwork for that action and we are both eager and determined to ensure that supporters and signatories remain committed to the CCA’s goals.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>In an effort to decarbonize the global crypto industry by prioritizing climate stewardship and creating the opportunity for the entire crypto industry’s transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the CCA has outlined the following objectives:</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:list -->
<ul><li>Achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption for CCA Signatories by 2030.</li><li>Develop standards, tools, and technologies with CCA Supporters to accelerate the adoption of and verify progress toward 100% renewably-powered blockchains by the 2025 UNFCCC COP30 conference.</li></ul>
<!-- /divi:list -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>“We are ready to roll up our sleeves and begin developing new solutions in support of the CCA,” said Jesse Morris, Chief Commercial Officer at Energy Web. “Based on early industry feedback about the CCA, we know that this green hash rate solution is critical to assist individual mining facilities prove their use of renewables and the industry as a whole to set an example for other industries to follow. We look forward to working closely with DMG, Argo, and other CCA Supporters to develop this solution and introduce it to the market as quickly as possible.”</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>With DMG, Argo, and over 40 organizations on board &#8211; including 20 prominent cryptocurrency organizations &#8211; the CCA is on a path to achieve the stated objectives through the promotion and use of renewable energy solutions. The CCA invites subject matter experts, and others in the space to sign onto and aid in the implementation of the working group.</p>

Blockseer has a range of crypto-specific services already operating, which include Explorer, Walletscore, Pool, and Mine Manager. As of today, Blockseer’s Pool platform, a licenced technology which includes “Clean Block” mining, is operating over 1 Exahash (1,000 Petahash) for its client.</p>



<p>Normally a pool will charge an average of 2% for its fees to users. Over a single week of mining with approximately 1 Exahash (1,000 Petahash) at today’s bitcoin price, it would be expected that pool fees charged would be approximately USD$45,000 per week per Exahash. DMG, licensing its technology, takes a negotiated fee via its overall pool fee for Blockseer’s services and technologies.</p>



<p>The Blockseer Pool is currently producing blocks at its statistically expected rate which, with its current hashrate, will generate approximately 225 bitcoin per month. As a critical component of our Core+ services, Blockseer&#8217;s mining pool is now an active revenue generator; with over 1 Eh/s running on the pool network for DMG’s client.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am incredibly proud of my team, and their diligent work over the last year to take our Blockseer Pool offering from inception to production. This represents the next step in DMG&#8217;s focus towards full vertical integration in the creation of bitcoin, and is the foundation for becoming more involved in the entire bitcoin ecosystem,” said Adrian Glover, Chief Technology Officer of DMG.</p>



<p>“DMG is very excited for the ongoing growth of the Blockseer platforms,” commented Sheldon Bennett, DMG’s CEO. “We now have four operating platforms (Explorer, Walletscore, Pool and Mine Manager), and with the coming additions of Breeze and Freeze (Blockseer’s custody wallet solutions), and Petra, which is now patent pending, and focuses on solving regulatory issues for banks and financial institutions as they add Bitcoin operations. In the coming months, as we move forward with our plans to add crypto exchange capabilities to Blockseer, DMG is investing significantly in new revenue generating products beyond pure crypto mining.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 31, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; After the execution of a memorandum of understanding in early January 2021, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MARA), (“<strong>Marathon</strong>”) and DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB-US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (“<strong>DMG</strong>”), a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency technology company, have entered into a definitive license agreement (the “<strong>Agreemen</strong>t”) to provide technology solutions for Marathon and the new Digital Currency Miners of North America (“<strong>DCMNA</strong>”) pool. Marathon is one of the largest enterprise Bitcoin self-mining companies in North America and will be launching the first North America-based Bitcoin mining pool that is fully compliant with U.S. regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC’s) standards. Unique features of DMG’s Blockseer pool technology include the ability to filter transactions to ensure AML and OFAC compliance in anticipation of impending US regulations.&nbsp;On a day-to-day basis, DCMNA will manage the pool with DMG providing strategic guidance and/or technical support as needed.</p>



<p>Marathon intends to direct 100% of its hashrate to the new mining pool. Marathon expects all 103,120 of its miners to be deployed by the first quarter of 2022, at which point, the Company will be directing 10.37 EH/s to the mining pool. In June 2021, the pool will begin accepting other U.S.-based Bitcoin mining companies.</p>



<p><strong><u>Terms of Agreement with Marathon</u></strong></p>



<p>As part of the Agreement, Marathon will be licensing DMG&#8217;s proprietary Blockseer pool technology to be used by the DCMNA entity. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, DMG will receive:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>(a)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>USD$500,000 in common shares of Marathon;</td></tr><tr><td>(b)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>a monthly license fee paid in cash or Bitcoin (at DMG’s election) with a sliding scale based on DCMNA’s block rewards and transaction fees received by the pool; and</td></tr><tr><td>(c)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>technical support services to be provided on an as-needed basis with payment in US dollars.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>&#8220;We are excited to provide our proprietary software tools to the DCMNA pool.. As more U.S.-based Bitcoin mining companies (and their hashrate) join DCMNA, DMG will receive more Bitcoin from licensing our technology,&#8221; said DMG’s CEO &amp; COO, Sheldon Bennett.</p>



<p>“While institutional interest in Bitcoin is accelerating, many large funds and corporations have expressed concerns over purchasing Bitcoin that may have been tainted by nefarious actors,” said Merrick Okamoto, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “Our pools’ initiatives are grounded on decentralization, transparency, legal compliance with U.S. rules and regulations, and independent auditability under U.S. auditing standards. While we appreciate some miners’ appetite for processing transactions indiscriminately, it is our belief that as a publicly listed company based in the United States, and as one focused on enabling more institutional adoption of Bitcoin, it is our responsibility to follow U.S. regulations. We believe that such regulatory compliant mining will allow us to produce ‘clean’ Bitcoin, which will enable a greater number of institutions to gain exposure to this new asset class, ultimately benefiting our organization, our shareholders, and the broader network.”</p>



<p>Okamoto continued, “Currently, more than two-thirds of Bitcoin’s global hashrate is concentrated in pools with little transparency, and most reside in one country. It is our belief that this concentration of hashrate outside of the United States, where central authorities could interfere with mining operations without due process, poses a risk to the network. We believe shifting more mining power to the U.S. could reduce these risks, potentially strengthening the network and benefitting all who participate in it. If all 10.37 EH/s of our potential hashrate were pointed towards this pool today, our mining pool would be the seventh largest bitcoin mining pool in the world, putting North America on the map as a digital-asset mining hub.”</p>



<p><strong><u>Management/Director Updates</u></strong></p>



<p>DMG also announces a change in senior management and the addition of a new director.</p>



<p>The Company reports that Daniel Reitzik has resigned from DMG as a director and as the Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Reitzik was one of the founders of DMG, and helped DMG grow from a small company in 2016 to a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain company. The Company thanks Mr. Reitzik for his contribution to DMG and wishes him all the best in his future endeavors.</p>



<p>Sheldon Bennett, also a founder, who leads the day-to-day operations of DMG, has been appointed CEO and will also continue in his position of Chief Operating Officer for the time being. With the appointment to CEO, Mr. Bennett will continue building on his role of developing new business opportunities, partnerships, and continuing to execute on bringing DMG’s products to market.</p>



<p>The Company is also pleased to announce that Steven Eliscu has joined DMG’s board of directors. In adding Mr. Eliscu, DMG gains a board member who will help oversee the Company’s continued transformation, while guiding it to focus on key long-term drivers of valuation. Mr. Eliscu currently works as Head of Finance for DSP Concepts, and he is an experienced Blockchain and technology industry veteran, with experience at Bitfury as well as having advised a number of Blockchain start-ups. Mr. Eliscu is also a former equity research analyst for UBS, having provided investment coverage of the semiconductor industry to institutional investors. Mr. Eliscu has a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Mr. Eliscu’s experience makes him ideal to chair the Board’s Audit Committee.</p>



<p>The Company also announces that it has granted 200,000 stock options with an exercise price of $2.49 to Mr. Eliscu for a three-year term.</p>



<p><strong><u>Terra Clean Energy Pool</u></strong></p>



<p>As previously disclosed on March 26, 2021, DMG and Argo Blockchain Plc will provide further updates on the Terra Pool as developments and progress occurs.</p>



<p><strong>About Marathon Digital Holdings Inc.</strong><br><br>Marathon is a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies, with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets.</p>



<p><strong>About DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.</strong></p>



<p>DMG is a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency company that manages, operates, and develops end-to-end digital solutions to monetize the blockchain ecosystem.

<p>VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (“<strong>DMG</strong>”), a vertically integrated blockchain and cryptocurrency technology company, and Argo Blockchain Plc (LSE: ARB) (“<strong>Argo”</strong>), a UK-based global cryptocurrency mining company, are pleased to announce Terra Pool (the “<strong>Pool</strong>”), the world’s first Bitcoin mining pool powered by clean energy. Aligning with the latest climate science, Terra Pool will work to better manage the impact of Bitcoin mining on the climate.</p>



<p>As founding shareholders and partners, DMG and Argo have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to establish Terra Pool, a cooperative effort to launch a Bitcoin mining pool exclusively powered by clean energy. Initially, the Pool will consist of both DMG’s and Argo’s hashrate, which currently uses energy generated by hydroelectric resources.</p>



<p>“DMG’s increased innovative strength and continued focus on eco-friendly Bitcoin mining has the opportunity to drive transformations in how the Bitcoin mining community acts towards a climate-conscious future,” said DMG CEO Dan Reitzik. “DMG’s ongoing commitment to clean energy-based capital deployment is a key industry development. We believe this is an opportunity for continued growth as we develop a better understanding of climate-friendly operations while simultaneously integrating the newest and most innovative blockchain technologies.”</p>



<p>Terra Pool will provide both a strong incentive and accessible platform for cryptocurrency miners to produce Bitcoin in a sustainable and climate-conscious way with the goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. In the near-term, Terra Pool will work with like-minded Bitcoin miners to expedite the shift from conventional power to clean energy.</p>
