<p>Bitcoin, once mined, is being used to provide additional value-added taxable services. How is it doing this? Bitcoin, the currency is not only a store of value, but also Bitcoin, the network is a foundation to provide next generation financial services. Why the Bitcoin network? The immutability of transactions that occur on the Bitcoin network assures that once a transaction occurs and has been confirmed a sufficient number of times, practically, it cannot be reversed. As the Bitcoin network has been in existence since 2009, with never a situation that the network was subverted by bad actors, it has become the most trusted public decentralized transaction network.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>In turn, Bitcoin has led the explosion of a new class of assets, cryptocurrency, where math (utilizing cryptographic algorithms, hence the name) is the basis for enabling a decentralized, peer-to-peer means for exchanging value. On the surface, Bitcoin may be confused with other “peer-to-peer” payment systems such as PayPal, but underneath, indeed, there is no central authority involved with bitcoin transactions, while there certainly is with PayPal.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>Rather, a set of consensus rules coded in the Bitcoin protocol for transaction validation and currency issuance along with a mechanism for reaching consensus using an algorithm called Proof-of-Work enable the network to function without the need for central authorities. The fact that Proof-of-Work can achieve network consensus as to if a new block of transactions should be added to the public ledger without a central trusted authority was a huge breakthrough in distributed computing that has applicability well beyond cryptocurrency – this was truly a landmark event in the field of computer science!</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Bitcoin network remains secure and enables transactions by way of a distributed network of computers performing very specific functions. The power of this network to assure transaction immutability is truly astronomical – in fact, the number of computations in just a few hours on the Bitcoin network exceeds the number of stars in the observable universe.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>The implications of this advance are enormous, as disintermediation is a promised benefit of technology, which may counter the other overarching characteristic of technology – that it is typically a winner-take-all result for those enterprises that can dominate in a particular specialty. These cryptocurrency networks led by Bitcoin are a threat to entrenched economic interests, whether they be financial institutions, central banks or even modern payment systems such as PayPal.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>Part of the confusion about Bitcoin is that is a network whose functional currency has the same name; however, it is usually spelled with a lower-case “b.” Bitcoin as a currency should rather be compared to a piece of ownership in the Bitcoin network, just as PayPal shares would represent ownership in the PayPal network, while PayPal transactions use different fiat currencies.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>So if trading bitcoin is more comparable to trading in the stock market, then why do we refer to it as currency at all? Just because it <em>can</em> be used as currency, doesn’t mean we should think of that way – the term “digital assets” is more appropriate, as it properly reflects the evolution of the Bitcoin network, where new higher-layer networks are evolving to enable functionality that reduces the friction of the many transaction types that occur in the real economy.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>Layered hierarchies occur in ecosystems because it makes sense to decouple certain functionality, as each layer serves different roles and evolves at different rates. A prime example is digital networking. While the base layers – physical layer, link layer are largely physical infrastructure – long-distance optical networks and switching functions that have limited software functionality – the higher layers (i.e., TCP/IP and application layers) are largely built using software running on servers.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>Likewise, the Bitcoin network is evolving to add layers of functionality on top of the base layer, which provides a proven technology for ensuring transaction immutability and resistance to censorship. Examples include Liquid for large financial transactions and Lightning for microtransactions, whose real-world analogs may have lots of transaction friction (which includes high fees, long settlement times) depending on the specific type of transaction. Unlike the layered networking model, which provides decoupling of topological features, these digital asset network layers perform different types of functionality with different capabilities regarding transaction throughput, settlement time, transaction fees, network provider rewards and security model.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>Liquid as a network provides for capabilities that cannot easily be realized by the Bitcoin blockchain, which has evolved slowly since its inception and is unlikely to provide radical new features that could undermine its security model. Asset types on Liquid are not limited to just a single currency but <em>any</em> digital asset, whether it be security tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or stablecoins (digital tokens that are tied one-for-one to either a fiat currency or another cryptocurrency). Additionally, transactions can be confirmed in just a few minutes rather than the typical hour for a bitcoin transaction. Transactions can also be transmitted in a way which hides the amounts and asset types from all third parties. Liquid transactions do not need to be settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it is so integrally linked to Bitcoin, that there would be no Liquid without Bitcoin.</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>To contrast, the Lightning Network was developed as a micropayments layer to Bitcoin. Lightning can scale to billions of transactions per second with near instantaneous settlement times, while Bitcoin is typically limited to less than ten transactions per second and one-hour settlement times. Additionally, transaction fees can be just fractions of a penny versus the typical 1% or greater fees through a bitcoin exchange. Immutability is assured, as Lightning transactions are initially funded from the Bitcoin network and are ultimately settled back onto the Bitcoin network once the rules of a preset Lightning smart contract finish to completion. Lightning is technically able to be applied to other networks, but its maximum utility comes from doing so on a network that gives the highest level of transaction immutability – Bitcoin!</p>
<p><!-- /divi:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- divi:paragraph --></p>
<p>Layering provides scalability that a single layer network solution cannot cost-effectively achieve while still retaining the immutability characteristics of the base Bitcoin layer. While this is still an area for rapid development, it only reinforces the idea that bitcoin is only a currency with limited utility is very much outmoded. In this extended model, the Bitcoin network becomes an aggregation and settlement layer, and it very much expands the value of bitcoin way beyond what its creators could have ever envisioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-left">With pushback from governments in China and Europe, the crypto mining industry is changing rapidly. Miners have to make a quick decision about where they want to move their operations to continue the sustainable mining of cryptocurrencies. Mining is about to become easier and more profitable for North American crypto miners, and it might even help to become the biggest crypto hub in the world.&nbsp; Let’s discuss why it is better for miners to mine cryptocurrencies in America rather than Europe or China.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">The U.S leading the charge</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USA-leading-the-charge.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-23538" width="384" height="256"/></figure></div>



<p>One of the biggest advantages is how well miners can navigate this industry through technology because there has been a global crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, meaning North Americans have much more freedom than their counterparts in Europe or China. California has significant technological talent, making this market much more favourable for cryptocurrency miners compared to the other markets in the world.</p>



<h1><meta charset="utf-8"></h1>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">How to find the best states for crypto mining in the US?</h1>



<p class="has-text-align-left">A few factors play a major role in finding the best states in the US for crypto mining, researchers at <a href="https://commodity.com/blog/states-crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="color:#1f32ab" class="has-inline-color">Commodity.com</span></a> analyzed data from the US Census Bureau, the US Energy Information Administration, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and HighSpeedInternet.com, creating a composite score based on the following factors:</p>



<ul><li>State Income Tax Burden</li><li>Electricity Rates</li><li>Cost of Living</li><li>Percentage of households with broadband access</li><li>Average internet speed</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Based on the aforementioned reasons, the best states for cryptocurrency mining are North Dakota, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. All three of these states have low or no state income taxes, below-average electricity rates, and low overall living costs.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">Crypto Regulations and China Crackdown</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/China-crackdown.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-23603" width="384" height="256"/></figure></div>



<p class="has-text-align-left">North America is currently at an advantage because there is a current lack of regulations on cryptocurrency mining and therefore no extra costs to incur or losses to make like countries in Europe or China. Cryptocurrency mining operations in China are quickly shutting down because of the periodic government crackdown on cryptocurrencies which is a huge motivation for most of the miners to jump ship and migrate to North America which offers better technology and in turn reduces the carbon footprint.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In addition to the news about Bitcoin and China, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also released information on digital assets. This is good news for miners because it means that cryptocurrencies can potentially be treated like securities, which means that they will be regulated under American laws. The SEC has essentially said that cryptocurrencies have the potential to be treated as securities because they have characteristics of assets and there is a developed market for them in the U.S. Because mining is an obvious source of income for cryptocurrency miners, it will benefit cryptocurrency miners if their products are considered as securities.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">Canada is catching up</h1>



<p>Canada’s bitcoin mining sector is often compared to the US’s own since both are on the same continent and competing for the same market. Canada has its advantages over the US. For instance, Canada’s import taxes are roughly 5% lower than the general sales tax on imported goods. Trump-era tariffs, along with the usual 2.6% duty levied on imported goods, add a 27.6% tax on the ASICs (Application-Scientific Integrated Circuit) that U.S. companies purchase from China. That’s a sizeable difference.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">Geographic Location sides with Canada</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/geographic-location-canada.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-23616" width="384" height="256"/></figure></div>



<p>Climatic conditions also play an important role in crypto mining. As you may know, the miners require a lot of equipment to keep them functioning without overheating. Canada offers better weather conditions (cold) as compared to the US. Cooler geographical regions allow for better efficiency of miners and reduce the chances of a miner overheating. Many crypto mining firms are located in Canada with locations offering cooler conditions &#8211; Hut8 in Alberta, Hive Blockchain in New Brunswick, and DMG Blockchain Solutions at Christina Lake in British Columbia.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">Getting Listed on Stock Exchanges</h1>



<p>Canadian companies traditionally have had an easier time getting listed on the stock exchange like the TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) as compared to their counterparts in the US. The presence of North America’s only ASIC manufacturer, ePIC Blockchain is based in Canada and when it does enter the Bitcoin ASIC market, Canadian miners will benefit from this a lot. Canada’s bitcoin mining sector will grow rapidly this decade but not as much as the US because of states like Texas and Wyoming which have fewer red tape restrictions thereby permitting accelerated business operations.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">DMG looks to close the bitcoin mining gap</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dmg-blockchain-solutions.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23622" width="512" height="225" srcset="https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dmg-blockchain-solutions.png 512w, https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dmg-blockchain-solutions-480x211.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw" /></figure></div>



<p><strong><a href="https://Dmgblockchain-invt.com/"><span style="color:#1f32ab" class="has-inline-color">DMG Blockchain Solutions</span></a></strong> is a Vancouver-based firm that is the frontrunner in bringing regulations to an almost unregulated industry. DMG has divided its business operations into two divisions &#8211; Core &amp; Core+. The core division is mainly focused on mining Bitcoin at its data center at Christina Lake is highly advantageous in terms of drawing power from the hydroelectric dam as well as cooler temperatures that improve mining efficiency. DMG also offers consultation services to fellow miners. On the other hand, the core+ division focuses on developing software that helps miners, as well as authorities, track mining operations and the flow of cryptocurrencies throughout the world while tackling money laundering in crypto transactions. DMG has partnered with various firms in the industry to launch new services and products which will bring regulations to the industry and make it more accessible for people around the world. China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining gave DMG the opportunity to close the gap and increase its hash rate to grow into one of the biggest crypto miners in Canada.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h1 class="has-text-align-center">What&#8217;s next?</h1>



<p>There are so many cryptocurrencies that have already been created, and they can be used as investment vehicles which makes the market more diverse in every way possible. This means that miners will also have more investment opportunities to choose from and can mine a number of different coins. North America has around 5 million people who are potentially interested in cryptocurrencies, but they only make up 3% of the global population. Because the market is so large, it means that there are many more potential customers out there who are looking for cryptocurrency mining solutions.</p>



<p>The benefits of cryptocurrency mining in North America are clear because they have better prices and more freedom. Mining in North America can lead to potential security regulations, but this is not as concerning because there will always be ways to navigate around them and ensure that businesses can continue to grow.</p>
